(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,x) -> Goal State

x -> Empty space

Heuristic -> Least possible cost to solve the puzzle. 

(1) x  x
 x  x  x
 x  x  1

Distance from 1 to (1) -> sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)


Heuristic evaluation pseudocode:

  total-h = 0

  For every obj: 

    obj-pos = Find(obj, current-tuple)

    obj-goal-pos = Find(obj, goal-tuple)

    total-h = distance(obj-pos, obj-goal-pos)
